            <p>The guard, hearing the noises coming from Teaching 1, decides to investigate with his dog. As he gets closer, the noises become more intense and disturbing, as if they were ritual chants mixed with cries of pain. The tension increases when the guard discovers traces of blood leading to the basement of the building.
                Descending the stairs, the guard finds an abandoned room that appears to have been used for some kind of dark ritual. The walls are covered with satanic symbols and there are unlit candles everywhere. Suddenly, a shadow quickly crosses his field of vision. The guard, frightened but determined, continues to advance, guided by the moans and whispers echoing in the air.
                In the center of the room, he finds several students and teachers bound and gagged, surrounded by a group of hooded people. The hooded men are in the middle of a ritual, reciting words in an ancient language. The leader of the group, who has a sinister appearance with tattoos of satanic symbols on his face, becomes aware of the guard's presence and shouts orders to the others.
                An intense confrontation ensues. The guard uses all his skills and the dog attacks the hooded men, but is clearly outnumbered. However, with ingenuity and bravery, he manages to free some of the prisoners, who help fight the narco-satanists.</p><br>
            <p>With the chaos unleashed, the guard and the freed prisoners manage to overpower several of the hooded men. However, the narco-satanic leader escapes, vowing revenge. The guard calls the police, who quickly arrive and arrest the remaining cult members.
                The police discover that the abandoned house near the UT is the narco-satanic headquarters. Upon searching the house, they find hard evidence connecting the cult to the disappearances. The rescued students and faculty are taken to the hospital for treatment, while the guard is hailed as a hero for his bravery.
                As news of the guard's heroic action spreads, UT tightens its security and investigations into the narco-satanic cult intensify. The guard, though scarred by the experience, is proud to have saved lives and determined to continue protecting his community.
                The narco-satanic leader is still at large, and although the immediate danger has been neutralized, the guard knows he must be ever vigilant, ready to face any threat that may arise in the future. The UT returns to normal, but the shadow of the narco-satanists still lingers, leaving a feeling of constant alertness in all those who witnessed the terrible events.</p>
